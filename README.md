#  Cancer hospital records database

The **cancer hospital records** ([RHC](http://www.fosp.saude.sp.gov.br/publicacoes/acessobancodados)) database is formed from data generated by several hospital institutions located in the State of São Paulo (Brazil) being coordinated by the [Fundação Oncocentro de São Paulo](http://www.fosp.saude.sp.gov.br/) (FOSP). The dataset is well documented, but this is only available in Portuguese.

The RHC:
* started its activities on 01/01/2000;
* has quarterly update;
* had their records anonymized;
* is formed by **analytical cases** (those who arrived at the institution without treatment, diagnosed or not);

RHC objectives: 
* know and improve the care provided to cancer patients during all stages of treatment;
* expand access to the state base and offer the possibility of performing specific tabulations and analyzes.

Pediatric tumors differ in location and morphology to tumors in adults and can be analyzed according to the International Classification of Cancer in Childhood (CICI), which defines the largest diagnostic groups.

The above information was adapted from the FOSP.

# Objective

Understand the data and make it more machine learnable.

This joint project was started at [Information Technology Center Renato Archer](https://www.cti.gov.br/).

* `2_EDA.ipynb`: presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the mentioned dataset

# How to use it

1. Create a virtual environment of your choice
2. Clone this github repository
3. pip install -r requeriments.txt
4. download the dataset from the FOSP
5. convert the dataset from dBase to csv format
   - The original file is a dBase database file, available in the format `.dbf`. 
   - We can convert the `.dbf` file to `.csv` using `Dbf5` from the library `simpledbf`.
   - The script and dataset are located in the subfolders /usr and /data, respectively.
   - To convert the file just run the following command on a terminal considering the above paths:
```python
python format_conversion.py --input "dbf file name" --output  "csv file name"
```







Libraries used in this project:
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `missingno`
* `simpledbf`
* `datetime`
